        <i><u><h1 id="redfort">Red Fort</h1></u></i>
        <p id="redp">The Red Fort (Lal Qila) is a grand symbol of Delhi’s rich history and architectural brilliance. Built in 1638 by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, it served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Constructed from striking red sandstone, the fort stands tall in Old Delhi, covering an area of over 250 acres. Its design beautifully blends Persian, Indian, and Timurid styles, with impressive walls, arched gateways, elegant pavilions, and lush gardens. Notable structures within the fort include the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), Rang Mahal, and the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque), each reflecting the luxury and artistry of the Mughal era.

Beyond its architectural splendor, the Red Fort holds great national significance. It became a key site during India’s struggle for independence and later a symbol of freedom. On 15th August 1947, India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the Indian flag from its ramparts, marking the country’s independence from British rule. Since then, every year on Independence Day, the Prime Minister continues this tradition, addressing the nation from the Red Fort.

In 2007, the fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognizing its historical and cultural importance. Today, it stands not only as a tourist attraction but also as a powerful reminder of India’s journey through time. Visitors can explore its majestic interiors, enjoy the evening Sound and Light Show, and walk through the same grounds where emperors once ruled and history was made.

Located near Chandni Chowk, the Red Fort is easily accessible and remains a must-visit destination for anyone wanting to experience the true spirit of Delhi.</p>

        <i><u><h1 id="redfort">India Gate</h1></u></i>
        <p id="redp">The India Gate is one of the most prominent and iconic landmarks in New Delhi, standing as a solemn tribute to the soldiers of the Indian Army who lost their lives in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Designed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, the monument was completed in 1931 and originally called the All India War Memorial. Towering at 42 meters, this majestic sandstone arch is situated at the heart of Delhi, along the ceremonial Rajpath, and resembles the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Engraved on the surface of India Gate are the names of over 13,000 Indian and British soldiers who died in battle. Beneath the archway lies the Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), which was added after India’s independence in 1971, in memory of the soldiers who gave their lives during the Indo-Pakistan War. This eternal flame was guarded continuously by soldiers of the Indian armed forces until it was merged with the National War Memorial in 2019.

More than just a war memorial, India Gate is also a place of reflection and national pride. Its surrounding lawns are popular with families and tourists, especially in the evenings when the monument is beautifully illuminated. National ceremonies, parades, and celebrations such as Republic Day often take place near this iconic structure, making it a focal point of national unity.

Located in central Delhi, India Gate is easily accessible and remains open to visitors throughout the day. Whether visited in daylight or under the glow of night lights, the India Gate stands as a powerful symbol of sacrifice, honor, and patriotism, making it a must-see destination for anyone exploring Delhi's rich historical and cultural landscape.

        <i><u><h1 id="redfort">Rashtrapati Bhavan</h1></u></i>
        <p id="redp">Rashtrapati Bhavan, located at the western end of Rajpath in New Delhi, is the official residence of the President of India. It is one of the largest and most magnificent residences of any head of state in the world. Originally known as the Viceroy’s House, it was designed by the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and constructed between 1912 and 1929 during the British colonial rule. The building was part of the larger plan to shift the capital of British India from Calcutta to Delhi.

Spread over 330 acres, the Rashtrapati Bhavan complex includes the main building, sprawling Mughal Gardens, staff quarters, stables, and other offices. The main building alone occupies 5 acres and has over 340 rooms, including the grand Durbar Hall, Ashoka Hall, Banquet Hall, and presidential living quarters. Built using cream and red sandstone, the architecture of Rashtrapati Bhavan is a stunning blend of Western classical style and Indian motifs, making it a unique symbol of Indo-British architecture. The building features massive pillars, intricate jaalis (latticed screens), and the iconic dome, which is inspired by the Great Stupa at Sanchi.

One of the highlights of Rashtrapati Bhavan is the Mughal Gardens, which were also designed by Lutyens in collaboration with horticulturist William Mustoe. These gardens are a mix of Mughal and English styles and feature a wide variety of flowers, fountains, and ornamental trees. They are open to the public every spring during the annual Udyanotsav.

Since independence in 1947, Rashtrapati Bhavan has served as the residence of all Indian Presidents. It is not just a residence but also a symbol of Indian democracy, where numerous important national ceremonies, official meetings, and diplomatic events are held. Visitors can explore parts of the Rashtrapati Bhavan through guided tours that include the museum complex, forecourts, and heritage gardens.

Rashtrapati Bhavan is more than a grand structure—it is a living legacy of India’s past and present. It stands as a testament to the architectural brilliance of Lutyens and the evolution of Indian governance. With its majestic presence and historical significance, Rashtrapati Bhavan remains one of the most iconic landmarks of India.

        <i><u><h1 id="redfort">Lotus Temple</h1></u></i>
        <p id="redp">The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is one of the most iconic and visually stunning architectural landmarks in the country. Also known as the Bahá'í House of Worship, it was completed in 1986 and is dedicated to the Bahá'í Faith, a religion that emphasizes the unity of all people and religions. What makes the Lotus Temple particularly special is its distinctive design—shaped like a lotus flower, which is a symbol of purity, peace, love, and divinity in Indian culture.

Designed by Iranian architect Fariborz Sahba, the temple is made of white marble imported from Greece and consists of 27 free-standing petals arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides. The temple has nine doors that open into a central prayer hall, which can accommodate around 2,500 people at a time. One of the most remarkable features of the Lotus Temple is that it is open to people of all religions, castes, and creeds. There are no idols, rituals, or sermons, and visitors are encouraged to meditate, pray, or sit in silence to reflect and find peace.

The temple stands amidst 26 acres of beautifully landscaped gardens, ponds, and walkways, offering a serene environment for visitors. It has received numerous architectural awards and international recognition for its innovative design and spiritual atmosphere. Its design combines modern engineering with symbolic beauty, making it not only a place of worship but also a masterpiece of architecture.

Since its opening, the Lotus Temple has become one of the most visited buildings in the world, attracting millions of tourists and spiritual seekers every year. It reflects the Bahá'í principles of unity, equality, and peaceful coexistence. The silence inside the prayer hall contrasts with the hustle of the outside world, offering a space for inner calm and reflection.

The Lotus Temple is more than just a religious site—it is a symbol of India's diversity and harmony, welcoming people from all walks of life. Whether you're visiting for spiritual reasons, architectural interest, or peaceful retreat, the Lotus Temple provides a unique and enriching experience. Its presence in the heart of Delhi serves as a reminder of the values of peace, unity, and respect for all faiths.
