        <i><u><h1 id="redfort">Red Fort</h1></u></i>
        <p id="redp">The Red Fort (Lal Qila) is a grand symbol of Delhi’s rich history and architectural brilliance. Built in 1638 by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, it served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Constructed from striking red sandstone, the fort stands tall in Old Delhi, covering an area of over 250 acres. Its design beautifully blends Persian, Indian, and Timurid styles, with impressive walls, arched gateways, elegant pavilions, and lush gardens. Notable structures within the fort include the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), Rang Mahal, and the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque), each reflecting the luxury and artistry of the Mughal era.

Beyond its architectural splendor, the Red Fort holds great national significance. It became a key site during India’s struggle for independence and later a symbol of freedom. On 15th August 1947, India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the Indian flag from its ramparts, marking the country’s independence from British rule. Since then, every year on Independence Day, the Prime Minister continues this tradition, addressing the nation from the Red Fort.

In 2007, the fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognizing its historical and cultural importance. Today, it stands not only as a tourist attraction but also as a powerful reminder of India’s journey through time. Visitors can explore its majestic interiors, enjoy the evening Sound and Light Show, and walk through the same grounds where emperors once ruled and history was made.

Located near Chandni Chowk, the Red Fort is easily accessible and remains a must-visit destination for anyone wanting to experience the true spirit of Delhi.</p>

        <i><u><h1 id="redfort">India Gate</h1></u></i>
        <p id="redp">The India Gate is one of the most prominent and iconic landmarks in New Delhi, standing as a solemn tribute to the soldiers of the Indian Army who lost their lives in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Designed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, the monument was completed in 1931 and originally called the All India War Memorial. Towering at 42 meters, this majestic sandstone arch is situated at the heart of Delhi, along the ceremonial Rajpath, and resembles the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Engraved on the surface of India Gate are the names of over 13,000 Indian and British soldiers who died in battle. Beneath the archway lies the Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), which was added after India’s independence in 1971, in memory of the soldiers who gave their lives during the Indo-Pakistan War. This eternal flame was guarded continuously by soldiers of the Indian armed forces until it was merged with the National War Memorial in 2019.

More than just a war memorial, India Gate is also a place of reflection and national pride. Its surrounding lawns are popular with families and tourists, especially in the evenings when the monument is beautifully illuminated. National ceremonies, parades, and celebrations such as Republic Day often take place near this iconic structure, making it a focal point of national unity.

Located in central Delhi, India Gate is easily accessible and remains open to visitors throughout the day. Whether visited in daylight or under the glow of night lights, the India Gate stands as a powerful symbol of sacrifice, honor, and patriotism, making it a must-see destination for anyone exploring Delhi's rich historical and cultural landscape.
